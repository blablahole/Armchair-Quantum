# Virtual Learning for Quantum Computational Chemistry (QCC)
This is a one-year research project that investigates online education and infrastructure for quantum computational chemistry. The project consists of weekly journals and learning materials for citizen science. The project tends to invite professional researchers and learners from non-technical backgrounds to give feedback regarding quality education and virtual collaborative environments.
