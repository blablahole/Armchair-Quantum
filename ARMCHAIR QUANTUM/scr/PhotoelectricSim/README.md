# Photoelectric Effect Simulator
This is a visual simulation of the Photoelectric Effect, written in Python 3 and Pygame.

# Download and Installation
## Download
To download the program, go to the Releases section of this repo. There is an executable file for Windows, any other platforms will have to use the Universal version. Note that the universal version requires Python 3 and Pygame as dependencies. The universal version is practically the same as cloning the project via Git.
## Running the program (Windows)
Extract the zip file and run Photoelectric.exe.
## Running the program (Universal)
You will need Python 3 and Pygame installed for this to run.
Extract the zip file, open the folder you extracted it to and open a terminal. Run the command `python3 photoelectric.py`.

# Using the software
- Use the sliders and drop down boxes in the top-left section of the window to change different settings such as the light intensity, light wavelength, and incident metal.
- You can create your own metals by clicking the Create New Metal button and filling in the details. The metal you created will be listed in the drop down menu.
- You can save the values for wavelength, intensity and metal using the Save Values button to reload at a later time. These values are saved to a file and can be reloaded after closing and reopening the program.
- These values as well as the custom metals can be deleted from the Storage Settings, found in the options menu in the top right.
- Please note this simulation only displays electrons of the highest energy level.
